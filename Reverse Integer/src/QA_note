7. Reverse Integer
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only hold integers within the 32-bit signed integer range.
For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
